Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have raised critical safety concerns, particularly when harmful outputs arise from inputs that appear benign in isolation. These risks often stem from subtle interactions between image-text pairs, which many existing safety mechanisms fail to detect. We propose a novel framework that instills situational safety awareness into VLMs through a prompt-based, training-free methodology. Our approach enables models to proactively recognize unsafe scenarios and generate safe responses without relying solely on supervised fine-tuning. Experimental results on the SIUO benchmark demonstrate substantial improvements in safety detection, highlighting the effectiveness of our alignment strategy in addressing multimodal vulnerabilities.
